services: # Defines the different containers (services) in your application
  backend: # The name of our backend service
    build: ./backend # Tells Compose to build an image using the Dockerfile in the ./backend directory
    ports:
      # Maps port 8000 on your host machine to port 80 inside the container
      # Format: "HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT"
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      # Mounts the local ./backend directory into the container's /app directory
      # This allows code changes locally to be reflected inside the container immediately
      # without rebuilding the image (essential for development with --reload)
      # Note: Dependencies in requirements.txt still need a rebuild if changed.
